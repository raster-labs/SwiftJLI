/// ISO/IEC 10918-2 (JPEG Part 2) Annex A — inverse-DCT accuracy procedure.
///
/// The standard defines a statistical conformance test for an 8×8 IDCT: feed
/// many random coefficient blocks through both the implementation's IDCT and a
/// double-precision reference IDCT (the exact separable cosine sum), then bound
/// the per-pixel error statistics. An implementation "conforms" when, over the
/// block ensemble, every one of these holds:
///
///   • peak absolute error              ≤ 1      (no reconstructed pel off by >1)
///   • peak per-position mean-sq error  ≤ 0.06
///   • overall mean-square error        ≤ 0.02
///   • peak per-position mean error     ≤ 0.015  (|bias| at any pel position)
///   • overall mean error               ≤ 0.0015 (|bias| over all positions)
///
/// The procedure is run for three input ranges (Annex A.3.3): coefficients drawn
/// so that the spatial reference output lands in [−256, 255], [−5, 5] and
/// [−300, 300]. We approximate the spec's input generation by drawing random
/// *spatial* blocks in each range, forward-transforming them to coefficients with
/// the exact DCT, rounding to integers (as a real encoder would), and using those
/// integer coefficients as the IDCT input — exactly the data an IDCT sees in a
/// decoder. The reference is computed in `Double`; the implementation under test
/// is ``DCT/inverse`` (the production Accelerate IDCT). A fixed-seed PRNG keeps
/// the test deterministic and CI-reproducible.
